# Kickstarting with Excel
  Analysis of fundraising campaigns with a database of over 4,000 historical Kickstarter campaign records
## Overview of Project
  
### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- Fundraising campaigns for theater projects tend to have a higher success rate if launched during the months of May, June, and July. 
- Campaigns launched during December tend to have a lower success rate
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Most fundraising campaigns for Theater/Plays have a goal of less than $15,000.  For these lower budget plays, projects with a fundraising goal of less than $5,000 have a high rate of success (over 70% success rate).
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- For the analysis of outcomes based on launch date, data are aggregated from a spend of nine years.  Although the aggregated data seems to indicate the Summer months have a better success rate, when looking at individual years, the pattern is not as clear.  Thus the aggregated data may have less predictive power than one may expect 
- sample size for higher budget Theater/Plays projects are limited, therefore the historic success rate for these higher budget campaigns are less useful in predicting future success rate for a similar type of projects

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
